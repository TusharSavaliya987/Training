//Mapped Types
/*1. Introduction to Mapped Types
Mapped types in TypeScript allow us to create new types by transforming existing ones,
making it possible to dynamically modify or adapt type structures.
They are especially useful for scenarios where we need to apply consistent rules
or changes to the properties of an existing type.

For example:

Converting all properties of a type to optional.
Making all properties read-only.
Applying transformations to property values.
These operations are achieved through TypeScript's utility types (like Partial, Readonly, Record, etc.) or custom implementations.

2. Why Mapped Types Are Useful
Dynamic Adjustments: Instead of rewriting types manually, mapped types automate transformations.
Improved Maintainability: Centralized transformations reduce code duplication and simplify updates.
Enhanced Type Safety: They enforce consistent type rules across a codebase.
